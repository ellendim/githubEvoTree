Figures - short notes:

"sample_comp" - Correlation-based heatmap based on only significantly (<0.05) co-expressed genes between two species showing degree of correlation between the samples of 2 species. Each pixel describes how correlated the gene expression is for the two species are for the respectable samples. E.g. how correlated is sample 5 in Aspen with sample 7 in Birch? This gives an impression of how the samples between the species align to each other. 

"hm_coex_sign_all" - Expression-based heatmap showing all significantly (<0.05) co-expressed genes for the individual species.

"conserved_ortho_groups_all" - Counts ortholog groups that are 1) ultra-conserved and 2) partially conserved, next to the number of these ortholog groups that have cliques (sub-group were all nodes (genes) are linked to eachother).

"hm_uuc_genes" - Similar to the heatmap above, but only with the ortholog groups with cliques with the rows ordered so that the orthologs are lined up.

The last figures are expression profiles of various GO-annotated ultra-conserved genes (from cliques).
